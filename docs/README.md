# ProjectX Documentation Hub

**Welcome to ProjectX Documentation!** 📚

This is your central hub for all project documentation. We've organized everything into two main categories to help you find what you need quickly.

## � Documentation Structure

ProjectX documentation is organized into two main folders:

### 1. **Development Docs/** 📝
**Real-time development records, technical changes, and version history**

This folder contains living documents that track actual development progress:

| Document | Purpose | When to Read |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **CHANGELOG.md** | Complete version history of all changes | When you want to see what was built in each version |
| **UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** | Documentation change tracker with commit details | When you need to understand recent updates |
| **MIGRATION_NOTES.md** | Next.js 14→16 & React 18→19 upgrade guide | When working with new framework features |
| **DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_REPORT.md** | Detailed report of doc changes | For comprehensive update overview |

**Use Development Docs when:**
- 🔍 You want to see what actually happened during development
- 📅 You need to track changes by date or commit
