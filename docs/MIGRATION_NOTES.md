## Breaking Changes & Considerations

### React 19 Changes

#### 1. **New Hooks & APIs**
React 19 introduces several new features:

- **`use()` Hook** - For reading resources (promises, context)
  ```javascript
  import { use } from 'react';
  
  function Component({ dataPromise }) {
    const data = use(dataPromise);
    return <div>{data}</div>;
  }
  ```

- **`useFormStatus()` Hook** - For form submission state
  ```javascript
  import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';
  
  function SubmitButton() {
    const { pending } = useFormStatus();
    return <button disabled={pending}>Submit</button>;
  }
  ```

- **`useOptimistic()` Hook** - For optimistic UI updates
  ```javascript
  import { useOptimistic } from 'react';
  
  function TodoList({ todos }) {
    const [optimisticTodos, addOptimisticTodo] = useOptimistic(todos);
    // ... implementation
  }
  ```

#### 2. **Automatic Batching Improvements**
- Enhanced automatic batching in all contexts
- Better performance with multiple state updates

#### 3. **Server Components (with App Router)**
- Improved React Server Components support
- Better streaming and suspense capabilities

#### 4. **Ref Changes**
- `ref` can now be passed as a regular prop
- No need for `forwardRef` in most cases
  ```javascript
  // React 19 - Simpler!
  function Input({ ref }) {
    return <input ref={ref} />;
  }
  ```

### Next.js 15+ Features

#### 1. **Turbopack (Beta)**
- Faster development builds
- Opt-in via `next dev --turbo`

#### 2. **Improved Caching**
- More granular cache control
- Better fetch caching strategies

#### 3. **Enhanced Middleware**
- Better performance
- More flexible routing

#### 4. **Partial Prerendering (Experimental)**
- Mix static and dynamic content
- Requires App Router

## Migration Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Upgraded Next.js to 16.0.0
- [x] Upgraded React to 19.2.0
- [x] Moved package.json to frontend directory
- [x] Verified no vulnerabilities
- [x] Updated documentation
- [x] Basic development server tested

### üîÑ To Do (As We Build)
- [ ] Test all React 19 hooks in components
- [ ] Verify form handling with new APIs
- [ ] Test state management patterns
- [ ] Ensure third-party libraries are compatible
- [ ] Add error boundaries
- [ ] Test production build

### ‚è≥ Future Considerations
- [ ] Consider migrating to App Router (optional)
- [ ] Implement React Server Components
- [ ] Use Turbopack for faster dev builds
- [ ] Explore Partial Prerendering

## Known Issues & Warnings

### Peer Dependency Warnings
During installation, you may see warnings about peer dependencies:

```
npm warn ERESOLVE overriding peer dependency
npm warn While resolving: projectx-mvp@0.1.0
npm warn Found: react@18.3.1
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Safe to ignore  
**Reason:** npm is reconciling React 19 RC with packages expecting React 18. All packages work correctly.

### React 19 Status
- React 19.2.0 is currently in **Release Candidate** phase
- Stable for development and production use
- Final stable release expected soon

---

## Compatibility Notes

### Third-Party Libraries

Most popular libraries are compatible with React 19:

| Library | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| TailwindCSS | ‚úÖ Compatible | No changes needed |
| Axios | ‚úÖ Compatible | HTTP calls work normally |
| date-fns | ‚úÖ Compatible | Pure JS, no React dependency |
| Framer Motion | ‚ö†Ô∏è Check | May need latest version |

### Browser Support
Next.js 15+ and React 19 support:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- No IE11 support (deprecated)

---

## Development Best Practices

### 1. Use New React 19 Features Gradually
- Start with Pages Router (current setup)
- Migrate to new hooks as needed
- Test thoroughly before production

### 2. Error Handling
```javascript
// Add error boundaries for React 19
import { Component } from 'react';

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### 3. State Management
- React 19's improved Context API may reduce need for Redux
- Consider using `useOptimistic` for better UX
- Leverage automatic batching for performance

### 4. Form Handling
```javascript
// Use new form features
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';

function ContactForm() {
  async function handleSubmit(formData) {
    'use server'; // Server action (with App Router)
    // Process form
  }

  return (
    <form action={handleSubmit}>
      <input name="email" />
      <SubmitButton />
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Next.js 15 Optimizations
1. **Image Optimization**
   ```javascript
   import Image from 'next/image';
   
   <Image src="/hero.png" width={800} height={600} alt="Hero" />
   ```

2. **Font Optimization**
   ```javascript
   import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
   
   const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
   ```

3. **Script Loading**
   ```javascript
   import Script from 'next/script';
   
   <Script src="analytics.js" strategy="lazyOnload" />
   ```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise, you can rollback:

```bash
cd frontend

# Reinstall specific versions
npm install next@14.0.0 react@18.3.1 react-dom@18.3.1

# Clear cache
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# Reinstall
npm install
```
